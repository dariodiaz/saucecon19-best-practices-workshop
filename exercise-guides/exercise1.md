# Exercise 1: Configure Automated Testing on SauceLabs

## Part One: Set Sauce Labs Account Credentials
1. Checkout branch `01_set_sauce_credentials `. Open `src > test > java > exercises > FullJourneyTest.java`
2. Login to [www.saucelabs.com](https://www.sauceslabs.com), and navigate to the User Settings section of your account profile.

3. Copy and paste your Username and SauceLabs Access Key to your local clipboard
4. Navigate back to IntelliJ and in the class `FullJourneyTest.java`, update the following variables:
      ```
      String sauceUserName = "SAUCE_USERNAME";
      String sauceAccessKey = "SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY";
      ```
5. Save and run your test by typing in the following in your terminal:
    ```
    mvn test
    ``` 
    you should see the results appear in your Sauce Labs Test Dashboard
    
## Part Two: Set Environment Variables
    
6. Next, modify the `sauceUserName` and `sauceAccessKey` variables to use Environment Variables:

    ```
       String sauceUserName = System.getenv("SAUCE_USERNAME");
       String sauceAccessKey = System.getenv("SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY");
    ```
7. At the bottom of IntelliJ select the Terminal tab:
8. In the Terminal set your Sauce Labs Environment variables:   
   ###### Mac OSX:
   ```
   $ export SAUCE_USERNAME="your saucelabs username"
   $ export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY="your saucelabs API access Key"
   ```
   ###### Windows:
   ```
   > set SAUCE_USERNAME="your saucelabs username"
   > set SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY="your saucelabs API access Key"
   ```
   > To set an environment variables permanently in Windows, you must append it to the `PATH` variable.
   > Go to "Control Panel > System > Windows version > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables > System Variables > Edit > New. Then enter the "Name" and "Value"
   
9. Test the environment variables
    ###### Mac OSX:
    ```
    $ echo $SAUCE_USERNAME
    $ echo $SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY
    ```
    ###### Windows:
    ```
    echo %SAUCE_USERNAME%
    echo %SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY%
    ```
10. Run your test using Maven
    ```
    mvn test
    ```
    You should see the following build info appear (after sometime) in your console:

    > ** Warning:**
    > If you have problems propogating your envirnoment variables into IntelliJ, try refreshing your by running any of the following commands: 
    >  * Navigate to your home directory `$ cd ~/`
    >  * Open your bash profile and update it `$ open -e .bash_profile`
    
    > Details to your `.bash_profile` to set them globally
    > ```
    >    export SAUCE_USERNAME="xxx"
    >    export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY="XXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX"
    >    launchctl setenv SAUCE_USERNAME $SAUCE_USERNAME
    >    launchctl setenv SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY $SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY
    > ```
  
</br>

## Part Three: Abstract Test Details:
1. In `src/test/java/exercises/` create a new class called `LoginFeatureTest`.
2. Create a new `@Test` class method called `ShouldBeAbleToLogin`:
    ```
    public class LoginFeatureTest {
        protected WebDriver driver;
        
        @Test
        public void ShouldBeAbleToLogin(Method method) {
    
        }
    }
    ```
3. In `FullJourneyTest`, copy everything related to the login feature
    and paste it into the `LoginFeatureTest` class method: `ShouldBeAbleToLogin`.
4. Add this `Assertion` at the end of the `ShouldBeAbleToLogin`:
    ```
    Assert.assertEquals("https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html", driver.getCurrentUrl());
    ```
5. Run the test:
    ```
    mvn test -Dtest=LoginFeatureTest
    ```
6. Create a **`@BeforeMethod`** that takes care of `WebDriver` instantiation and setting `capabilities` before we run our test, and add an **`@AfterMethod`** to send the test results to Sauce Labs
7. Run the final test of this exercise:
    ```
    mvn test -Dtest=LoginFeatureTest
    ```

8. Use `git stash` or `git commit` to discard or save your changes. Checkout the next branch to proceed to the next exercise
>>>>>>> master
    ```
    git checkout 02_create_page_objects
    ```
